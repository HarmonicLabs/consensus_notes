    description = {
        Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism 
        used in blockchain networks to validate transactions and secure 
        the network. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), which requires computational 
        power to solve cryptographic puzzles, PoS selects validators 
        based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" 
        as collateral. The probability of being chosen as a validator is 
        proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency staked. This approach 
        significantly reduces energy consumption, increases efficiency, 
        and enhances security against certain types of attacks. PoS also 
        incentivizes participants to act honestly, as malicious behavior 
        can lead to the loss of their staked coins.

        Smart contracts are a revolutionary concept in the blockchain and 
        cryptocurrency space. They are self-executing contracts with the terms 
        of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into 
        lines of code.
